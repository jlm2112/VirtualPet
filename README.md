# VirtualPet
-The virtual pet Stacy has 3 attributes: hunger, thirst, and temperature. They increment at a semi-random rate, and she will tell you when she needs things.

-Stacy can't feed or water herself, but has the ability to heat herself up on her warm rock when very cold.

-Careful: If Stacy's thirst or hunger get to 100, she will die.

-But if she dies, you can always try again (she's virtual after all, so no big deal).
